		<h2>List of my favorite journalism stories:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a48031/the-falling-man-tom-junod/">The Falling Man</a> by Tom Junod</h3>
				<p>This article delves into the identity of an unidentified man photographed jumping from the World Trade Center during 9/11. Junod uses care and tact to explore the topic, making the piece memorable to all those who read it.</p>
			</li>

				<h3> <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-one">The Problem We All Live With</a> by This American Life</h3>
				<p> I enjoyed how Nikole Hannah Jones explores a school district's implementation of a desegregation program in their schools. The piece placed the seemingly historic notion of desegregation in the present and made it relevant to the listener.

				<h3> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> by John Hersey</h3>
				<p>
					The New Yorker dedicated an entire issue to Hersey's when it was released in 1946. Hersey describes the violent reality of an atomic bombing in plain English for readers just one year after the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
